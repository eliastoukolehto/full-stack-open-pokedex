In the case that we have an application programmed in python, linting can be set up with Pylint. Pytest can be used for testing, or in the case of web applications we can also use robot framework which is an intuitive tool for end-to-end tests. Poetry is a good tool for managing and building python applications. 
Many cloud service providers have their own CI/CD tools. Amazon web services has CodePipeline for automating CD in AWS and Microsoft Azure has Azure Pipelines. There also are many tools that are trying to enhance CI/CD through GitHub, such as GitLab, which advertises itself as a DevSecOps platform or CircleCi, which aims to provide a fast and beginner friendly CI/CD tool.  
Since we have a small team, I would assume that the application is a product by a start-up, or a group project and we wouldnâ€™t really have our own infrastructure. If we wanted to host the application ourselves, we would need to purchase a server for hosting purposes, we would also need to consider the scale of our application to know what kind of server we would need. The good thing about cloud-based environments is that they are easy to scale and set up, but they will be more costly in the long term. In the end I think it would come down to preference, and I personally am more interested in self-hosting options.
